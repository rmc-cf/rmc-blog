After going around and coming into contact with numerous technology stacks, I found that Flutter is still the most friendly cross-platform language. As for RN, I still feel a bit uncomfortable. Maybe it's because I prefer something with stronger compatibility.

## 说明
::: tip Contemplation
I feel like I've learned so much that I'm really confused. I forget things very quickly. I really need to carefully choose a few languages for in-depth study instead of neglecting one for another. Fortunately, the language style of RN is not much different from React, and the learning cost is acceptable. I didn't delve deeply into complex business process handling. I only did a superficial study of UI and interface requests and found that they were almost the same. I think the style of Flutter is somewhat similar to that of HarmonyOS, but not exactly the same. Both are nested layer by layer.
