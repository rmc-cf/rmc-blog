This is an article about my first contact with `FastAPI`


<!-- more -->


## Explanation
::: tip Insights
I think `FastAPI` can automatically generate `Swagger` documents, which is very good. Moreover, `FastAPI` has a unique performance advantage among python web frameworks (but not to belitten other Web frameworks). Therefore, among python web frameworks, I still chose `FastAPI` for learning. Before this, I also used `Django` for template development and front-end and back-end separation development. However, I found that once I didn't use `Django` for a long time, I needed to consume some learning costs. Similarly, I think the project structure of `Django` is a bit large. After I came into contact with `FastAPI`, I felt that the writing style of `FastAPI` is somewhat similar to nest, with a more annotated style. So, in the python web framework in the future, I should continue to learn to use `FastAPI`, carry out more development of front-end and back-end separation projects, and gradually understand and learn `FastAPI`.
